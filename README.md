## Website

You can visit the project [here](https://tintobit.biz/). This domain is temporary, we'll acquire fosfoyesos.info soon!

## Project purpose

Manuel Camacho Campos ([iBManu](https://github.com/iBManu)) and I saw a problem: phosphogypsum stacks in Huelva generate a lot of interest, but there isn't a website or book explaining the subject.

As we believe that all citizens of Huelva should be able to learn about this topic, we're developing fosfoyesos.info.

José María González Abad ([pepec0de](https://github.com/pepec0de)) and Diego Cerezo Rojas ([tetrix450](https://github.com/tetrix450)) believed and joined to this project. We're an amazing friends team.

fosfoyesos.info is also possible thanks to José Enrique Martín Domínguez and Juan Pedro Bolívar Raya. They have taught us many ideas, and we're delighted to bring them to people.

## To do now

1. Complete "Can phosphogypsum be recycled and valorized?" section.
2. Contact Prayon.
3. Add a Spanish version.

## TO-DO (in the near future)
* Contact Florida Industrial and Phosphate Research Institute (fipr.floridapoly.edu).
