## Project purpose

Manuel Camacho Campos ([iBManu](https://github.com/iBManu)) and I saw a problem: phosphogypsum stacks in Huelva generate a lot of interest, but there isn't a website or book explaining the subject.

As we believe that all citizens of Huelva should be able to learn about this topic, we're developing [fosfoyesos.info](https://fosfoyesos.info).

José María González Abad ([pepec0de](https://github.com/pepec0de)) believed and joined to this project. We're an amazing friends team.

[fosfoyesos.info](https://fosfoyesos.info) is also possible thanks to José Enrique Martín Domínguez and Juan Pedro Bolívar Raya. They have taught us many ideas, and we're delighted to bring them to people.
